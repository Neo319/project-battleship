        <h3>Instructions: </h3>
        <p>
            In Battleship, players try to locate enemy ships by shooting shots
            at sectors in a 10 x 10 grid before the opponent locates and takes down your ships.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start by using the "Generate New Layout" Button to position your ships, then use
            the "Start" button to begin a game. Click on the Computer's Gameboard (the upper square)
            to input an attack. Play against a simple computer that uses 
            random moves. You can press "Reset" to begin a new game at any time.
